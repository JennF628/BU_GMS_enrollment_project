# BU_GMS_enrollment_project
BU medical school have  whole range different programs, each of them are unique. Right now they are trying to combine efforts with advertising and outreach to enhace enrollments, make sure that these programs are healthy.

One of thing they would like to get a sense early in the admission cycle of certain programs which applicants are low, and easy to track then in a better way not just numbers.

Thus, this project focuses on analyzing past data in order to allow the administration of Boston University Graduate Medical School better clarity on the size of their student bodies. 
Through exploring past admissions, we set up a forecast model for the ongoing admission cycles.
More importantly, we customised rules based on sixsigma principle, and then combined forecast trendings with control chart to identified the early warning triggers for underperforming programs.
